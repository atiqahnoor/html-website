  <p> My dad's name is Noor Azizan bin Abdul Raman. He's 54 years old. In our family, we called him Ayah. He's a Senior Engineer at Toyo CR Sdn. Bhd.. I would describe my dad as someone who are strict but very supportive. He likes fishing very much and when I was little, he brought me to go fishing. One of the things that I admire about my dad is he's a hard-working, responsible, and humble person. Most of my character traits are from my father because I learn from his actions and probably because I'm Ayah's little girl. He's a family oriented person that always care to my grandmother. He made me realized that family is the valuable things. To always cherish our parents while they still alive.</p>

<p>Next is my mom, her name is Rohayu binti Zakaria. She's 44 years old. We called her Ibu in the family. She works as Logistic Administrator at Panasonic Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.. She's very loving and caring mother to me. When her children sick, she always take care of us. As someone who is the eldest in the siblings, I admire her courageous and unselfish. She knows that I love food very much and she never fails to make me happy with her cooking especially my favourite food. Besides, she loves to go to the beach, forest, hills and so on. I grew up going to these places often. Hence, I love the calming and fresh environment just like my mom.</p>

  <p> My brother's name is Nur Amri Shahzilee. He's 20 years old. Currently he's studying Diploma in Computer Science at UiTM Arau Perlis. He's very kind and loving brother. He's charming in his own way and soft spoken with everyone around him. Always help his sister to take the shopee parcel when it's arrived. I couldn't ask for more than a nice brother. We are very closed to each other because we went to the same secondary and high school together. I spent many times with my brother during school days. To me, he's very precious and I always protect him because that time he's my only brother.</p>
